    <h1>What is White Space</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, programmers use extra blank space between two words or break a paragraph, just
    to make them understand the text or code easily. These spaces are called 'White Space'. 
    Like-wise, we have done this by breaking this very paragraph.</p>
    <p>Usually, the browsers ignore that White Space and display the text without that white 
    space.</p>
    <h1>What is a Line Break</h1>
    <p>We use line break to enhance the beautification of a paragraph.</p>
    <p>Line break does not add or remove from the text of a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is an empty element, therefore, needs not to be closed.</p>
    <p>For example,<br>When it rains:<br>water comes,<br> if more rain continue, then more 
    water comes.</p>
