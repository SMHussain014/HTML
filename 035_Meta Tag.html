    <h1>What is Meta Tag</h1>

    & info about author of that web-site.</p>
    <h1>How to use Meta Tag</h1>

    <P>Meta:utf, and Meta:viewpoint will be appeared by default.</P>
    <p>Meta: utf-8 tells about coding language and Meta:viewpoint tells about width=device-width,
    i.e. device size and initial-scale=1.1, i.e. initial viewable area.</p>

    etc.</p>
