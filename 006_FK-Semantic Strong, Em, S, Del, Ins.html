    <h1>Types of Code in HTML5</h1>
    <p>There are two types of codes which are in use in HTML5, i.e. Structural Code and 
    Semantic Code.</p>
    <p>Structural codes are conventional codes that we are using previously. However, to cope 
    with emerging technology of now-a-days, Semantic codes have also been invented so that 
    disabled persons, specially blind, may also use web.</p>
    <p>Semantic code works like conventional structural code and caste no effect on web-site, but 
    they enables Search Engines and Screen Readers to help out disabled person.</p>
    <p>With the introduction of new regime laws, it is necessary to use semantic codes in their 
    letter and spirit.</p>
    <h2>Semantic Strong Tag</h2>
    <p>This tag functions, like previous bold tag, and is used to emphasize the text.</p>
    <p><strong>This sample is being typed in semantic code.</strong></p>
    <h2>Semantic EM Tag</h2>
    <p>This tag functions, like italic tag, and shows importance of that text.</p>
    <p><em>This sample is being typed in semantic code.</em></p>
    <h2>S Tag</h2>
    <p>This tag simply defines that the text is no longer correct.</p>
    <p>Apple iPhone Pro: <s>was $1199</s>, now only $1000.</p>
    <h2>Del & Ins Tags</h2>
    <p>The del & ins tags, at the same time, strike the old text and provide new text.</p>
    <p>We use <del>HTML4</del> <ins>HTML5</ins> to create the structure of a webpages.</p>
