    <h1>Difference between abbr. and acronym</h1>
    <p>Every acronym is an abbr. but every abbr. is not an acronym.</p>
    <p>The only difference is that every abbr. is a standard term whereas acronym lacks such 
    authority.</p>

    <p>The both tags are semantic in nature and their print/result will be italic.</p>
    <p>The citation tag tells about the reference from where a piece of information has been 
    extracted.</p>
    <p>sometimes, cite tag is used to highlight the title of a continuous paragraph.</p>
    <p>The definition tag simply defines a new term.</p>

    <h1>Types of Quotations in HTML5</h1>
    <p>There are two types of quotations (semantic in nature) are in use.</p>
    <p>For longer quotations, we use blockquote tag with cite attribute.</p>
    <p>For shorter quotations, q tag is used.</p>
    <p>Don't use 'q tag' for creating double quotes around a word or phrase.</p>
    <h2>Blockquote Tag</h2>
