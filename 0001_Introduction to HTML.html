This file will introduce us about HTML. 
    What is difference between an App and a Web-site?
        1.  If we use a web-page at Mobile, like WhatsApp, is called an App.
        2.  If we use the same web-page at desktop computer or laptop is called web-site.
    What is meant by Web-Development?
        Speaking widely, it consists of three elements:
        a.  HTML gives us the structure of a web-site.
        b.  CSS tells us about appearance of a web-site, i.e. its beautification.
        c.  JavaScript, i.e. a programming language, provides soul (dynamic features) to a 
            web-site and also defines its behaviour.
    How to get started?
        This topic involves two aspects;
        (i) where to write html code, and (ii) where to view the result of that coding. 
        HTML Code is usually written in a text editor like, Notepad, NotePad+, Atoms, 
        Visual Studio Code etc.    
        The result of these codes may be seen at a browser, like Google Chrome etc.
    Steps to start working.
        Install VSC on your computer. 
        Create a folder so to arrange your work at the same place.
        create a file in that folder, the extension of file will be ".html", like file_name.html.
    What is HTML stands for?
        HTML stands for 'Hyper Text Markup Language'. It is used to create web-pages and 
        describes their structure.
    WHat is TAG?
        All the commands or codes are written between angle brackets "<" and ">". In technical 
        language, we refer the code, written between angle brackets as tag.
        Usually, we have a pair of tags, i.e. < > opening tag and </ > closing tag. 
    What is ELEMENT?
        All the content (text to be displayed on a web-page or an App), opening and closing tags
        containing certain code, as a whole, are called element.  
        Content is always written between opening & closing tags and Code is written between angle
        brackets.
        Every element has a specific name, i.e code, which corresponds to its working or 
        functionality, e.g. <p> is a paragraph element. 
        HTML consists of a series of elements that tells the browsers how to display the content.
        In case of absence of content, a tag needs not to be closed with the help of closing tag.
        This type of element is called empty element, like <br> is a line break empty element.
    What is ATTRIBUTE?
        Attribute is merely some additional information relating to an element necessitated to 
        perform a task in a better way. These always be provided in an opening tag. They have 
        two parts, i.e. their name and their value.
    What is COMMENTS?
        Comments are notes for other programmers and describe the purpose of a program. 
        The comments are non-printable. This whole page is written as comments.
    How ro work Fast?
        Use 'emmet abbreviations' in VSC to work fast. The use of which we will learn as we
        started learning CSS. For further reading go to 'emmet cheat sheet' on google.
