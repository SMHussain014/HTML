<body style="background-color:skyblue;">
    <h1>Hyperlink</h1>
    <p>A hyperlink or simply link refers to navigate, jump or move from one place to another.</p>
    <p>To create a hyperlink or link, we have an element called 'Anchor' Tag.</p>
    <p>The following are the applications of a hyperlink:
    <ol>
        <li>to move from a website to another website;</li>
        <li>to join various web-pages of a website with each and other;</li>
        <li>to jump from one section of a webpage to other section;</li>
        <li>to display an image, an Audio Recording, a Video clip etc.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h1>Types of Hyperlink</h1>
    <p>There are two primary types, a link has have:
    <ol>
        <li>Absolute Link</li>
        <li>Relative Link</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h1>Absolute Link</h1>
    <p>This link is used to navigate from one website to another website.</p>
    <p>To navigate, we need the address or domain name of a website which is called "url"</p>
    <p>Domain name refers to a distinct and separate website.</p>
    <p>Every website has its own server.</p>
    <p>Uniform Resource Locater (URL) consists of four main parts:
    <ol>
        <li>Scheme</li>
        <li>Server Name</li>
        <li>Path; and</li>
        <li>Resource</li>
    </ol></p>
    <p>To understand the concept, we consider the following example:<br>
        https:\www.piaic.org\docs\entrytestkarachi</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scheme = http:</li>
        <li>Server Name = www.piaic.org</li>
        <li>Path = docs;</li>
        <li>Resource = entrytestkarachi</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Relative Link</h1>
    <p>This link is used to navigate within one website.</p>
    <p>Actually, this type of link enables us to link all the webpages of a web-site.</p>
    <p>To move through different webpages or sections of a website, we need a directory structure.</p>
    <p>The directory structure may be understood with the example of a family tree.</p>
    <p>Directory is simply a container where we keep our all the data.</p>
    <p>Designing 'Directory Structure' marks the beginning of a project.</p>
    <p>The main directory, where all the data is kept, is called 'Root Directory'.</p>
    <p>A root directory may contains sub-directories, files, images, audios, videos etc.</p>
