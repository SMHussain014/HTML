    <h1>What is White Space</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, programmers use extra blank space between two words or break a paragraph, just
    to enable them to understand the text or code easily. These spaces are called 'White Space'. 
    Like-wise, we have done this by breaking this very paragraph into three lines.</p>
    <p>Usually, the browser ignores this White Space and displays the text without it.</p>
    <hr style="color: red">
    <h1>What is a Line Break</h1>
    <p>Line break defines a single line break between two items.</p>
    <p>It does not add or remove anything from the content.</p>
    <p>It is an empty element, therefore, needs not to be closed.</p>
    <p>For example,</br>When it rains:</br>water comes,</br> if more rain continue, then more 
    water comes.</p>
    <hr style="color: blue"></pre>
    <h1>What is Horizontal Rule</h1>
    <p>Horizontal Rule defines thematic change in content and is an empty element.</p>
    <p>It is used to create a horizontal line between two topics.</p>
    <p>Look carefully, we have already applied this between each topic above.</p>
