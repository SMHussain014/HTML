    <h1>Concept of Forms in HTML</h1>
    <p>Forms are created to collect information from the user.</p>
    <p>In general, a form has three major types of information, i.e. Adding text, Making Choices
    & Submitting Forms.</p>
    <p>Each major type is sub-divided into further types depending upon our requirements, e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding text is sub-divided into one line data, like name etc., & long lines data, 
        like textarea;</li>
        <li>Making Choices are sub-divided into radio button, checkbox, drop-down boxes etc; and</li>
        <li>Submitting Forms are also sub-divided into submit button and uploading files etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A form can be created with 'form' tag. It has two attributes, i.e. action and method.</p>
    <p>Attribute 'action' tell the browser to take the data to the server.</p>
    <p>Attribute 'method' specifies the mood in which data is transferred. We have two methods,
    i.e. get and post</p>
    <p>Small data is transmitted by method 'get' which is also default method to submit data. 
    The length of small data is limited to 2048 characters. Method 'get' is not secure as entered
    data will be displayed in the title of browser. However, it is useful in searching quick 
    queries etc.</p>
    <p>Long data is normally submitted through method 'post'. This is the safe and preferable 
    method. All personal or sensitive information may be sent through post method.</p>
