        Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. 
        These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies based on physically wired, optical, 
        and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.</p>
        <h1>Network Addresses</h1>
        <p>The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other 
        specialized or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by network addresses and may have host names. 
        Host names serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after initial assignment. Network 
        addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet 
        Protocol.</p>
