    <h1>How Horizontal Rule Tag Works?</h1>
    <p>Horizontal Rule Tag, like Line Break Tag, does not add or remove from the text of a 
    paragraph. It is also an empty element.</p>
    <p>It is used to create a horizontal line between two topics/ things.</p>
    <p>For example;<br></p>
    <h1>What is White Space</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, programmers use extra blank space between two words or break a paragraph, just 
    to make them understand the text or code easily. These spaces are called 'White Space'.</p>
    <p>Usually, the browsers ignore that White Space and display the text without that white 
    space.</p>
    <hr color="black">
    <h1>What is a Line Break</h1>
    <p>We use line break to enhance the beautification of a paragraph.</p>
    <p>For example,<br>When it rains:<br>water comes,<br> if more rain continue, then more 
    water comes.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h1>How Pre Tag Functions?</h1>
    <p>Pre Tag is used to tell the browser to use the same formatting as a programmer desires.</p>
    <p>It is used to create two parallel horizontal lines before and after a topic.</p>
    <p>For example; we created red horizontal rule before and blue horizontal after the paragraph.</p><br>
