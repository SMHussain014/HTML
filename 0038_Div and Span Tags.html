    <h1>How div tag Function</h1>
    <p>by the use of 'div' tag, we can divide a web-page into various parts.</p>
    <p>Note that div tag is a block. A block always starts with new line.</p>
    <p>Although, div tag divides a web-page into separated sections but it makes a huge block 
    which acquires whole space on a web-page, meaning thereby, no new item can be placed in that
    space.</p>
    <div style="border:10px solid red; background-color:blue; color:white;">
    <h2>Culture Diversity:</h2>

    <h2>Culture walks on Tradition:</h2>

    <h1>How span tag Function</h1>
    <p>Note that span tag is an element. An element does not starts with new line.</p>
    <p>Unlike div tag, it does not acquire whole space of a webpage. New item starts from where
    a span element finished.</p><br>
    <h1>Network Addresses</h1>
    <p>The nodes of a <span style="color:red; background:yellow;">computer network can 
    include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialized or 
    general-purpose hosts.</span> They are identified by network addresses and may have host 
    names. Host names serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after 
    initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by 
    communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.</p>
