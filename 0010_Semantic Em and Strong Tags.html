            <h1>Types of Code in HTML5</h1>
            <p>There are two types of codes which are in use in HTML5, i.e. Structural Code and Semantic Code.</p>
            <p>Structural codes are conventional codes that we are using previously. However, to cope with emerging 
            technology of now-a-days, Semantic codes have also been invented so that disabled persons, specially blind,
            may also use web.</p>
            <p>Semantic code works like conventional structural code and caste no effect on web-site, but they enables 
            Search Engines and Screen Readers to help out disabled person.</p>
            <p>With the introduction of new regime laws, it is necessary to use semantic codes in their letter and 
            spirit.</p>
            <h2>Semantic strong Tag</h2>
            <p>This tag functions like bold tag.</p>
            <p><strong>This sample is being typed in semantic code.</strong></p>
            <h2>Semantic em Tag</h2>
            <p>This tag functions like italic tag.</p>
            <p><em>This sample is being typed in semantic code.</em></p>
