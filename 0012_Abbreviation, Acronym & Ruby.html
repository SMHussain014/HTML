    <h1>Difference between abbr. and acronym</h1>
    <p>Every acronym is an abbr. but every abbr. is not an acronym.</p>
    <p>The only difference is that every abbr. is a standard term whereas acronym lacks such 
    authority.</p>
    <p>In HTML5, use of acronym has been abandoned.</p>
    <p>Both (semantic in nature) have an attribute 'title'.</p>
