    <h1>How to navigate within the same Page</h1>
    <p>To stay within the same web-page, we usually use '#' with 'search_name' as a value to
    'href' attribute.</p>
    <p>To call that link, we use 'name' attribute with anchor tag.</p>
    <p>In place of 'name' attribute, 'id' attribute can also be used.</p>
    <h1>How to access an Article quickly</h1>
    <p>Usually, in longer articles, we have to scroll the same page repeatedly.</p>
    <p>To avoid this situation, an article may be divided into smaller parts by using 'div' tag.</p>
    <p>These smaller parts, later on, may be converted into hyperlinks, which are called,
    as and when required.</p>
    <p>The benefit of this division is to make search easy.</p>
    <p>Since, each part acts separately, these be utilized and formatted as demand occurs.</p>
    <p>The example, given below, may demonstrate the process <i>per se</i>.</p>

            <h2><a name="intro">Introduction:</a></h2>
            <p>Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (Arabic: أبو عبد الله الحسين بن علي بن أبي طالب;
                January 626 – 10 October 680) was a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a son of
                Ali ibn Abi Talib and Muhammad's daughter Fatima, as well as a younger brother of Hasan ibn Ali.</p>

            <h2><a name="in">Place in History:</a></h2>
            <p>He is the third Imam of Shia Islam after his brother, Hasan, and before his son, Ali ibn Husayn
                Zayn al-Abidin. Being a grandson of the prophet, he is a member of the Ahl al-Bayt. He is also
                considered to be a member of the Ahl al-Kisa, and a participant in the event of Mubahala. Muhammad
                described him and his brother, Hasan, as "the leaders of the youth of Paradise."</p>

            <h2><a name="the">Life After the Islamic Prophet:</a></h2>
            <p>During the caliphate of Ali, Husayn accompanied him in wars. After the assassination of Ali, he
                obeyed his brother in recognizing the Hasan–Muawiya treaty, despite it being suggested to do
                otherwise. In the nine-year period between Hasan's abdication in AH 41 (660 CE) and his death in
                AH 49 (669 CE), Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political
                involvement for or against Mu'awiya.</p>

            <h2><a name="life">Political Life in Medina:</a></h2>
            <p>After the death of Hasan, when Iraqis turned to Husayn, concerning an uprising, Husayn
                instructed them to wait as long as Mu'awiya was alive due to Hasan's peace treaty with him. Prior
                to his death, Mu'awiya appointed his son Yazid as his successor, contrary to the Hasan–Muawiya
                treaty. When Mu'awiya died in 680, Yazid demanded that Husayn pledge allegiance to him. Husayn
                refused to do so.</p>

            <h2><a name="cal">Political Life after leaving Medina:</a></h2>
            <p>As a consequence, he left Medina, his hometown, to take refuge in Mecca in AH 60 (679 CE).
                There, the people of Kufa sent letters to him, invited him to Kufa and asked him to be their Imam
                and pledged their allegiance to him. On Husayn's way to Kufa with a retinue of about 72 men, his
                caravan was intercepted by a 1,000-strong army of the caliph at some distance from Kufa. He was
                forced to head north and encamp in the plain of Karbala on 2 October, where a larger Umayyad army
                of 4,000 arrived soon afterwards. Negotiations failed after the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn
                Ziyad refused Husayn safe passage without submitting to his authority, a condition declined by
                Husayn.</p>

            <h2><a name="dom">Martyrdom:</a></h2>
            <p>Battle ensued on 10 October during which Husayn was killed along with most of his relatives and
                companions, while his surviving family members were taken prisoner.</p>

            <h2><a name="of">Impacts of Battle of Karbala:</a></h2>
            <p>The Battle of Karbala galvanized the development of the pro-Alid party (Shi'at Ali) into a
                unique religious sect with its own rituals and collective memory. It has a central place in the
                Shi'a history, tradition, and theology, and has frequently been recounted in Shi'a literature.</p>

        <div>
            <h2><a name="for">Symbol for Justice:</a></h2>
            <p>For the Shi'a, Husayn's suffering and death became a symbol of sacrifice in the struggle for
                right against wrong, and for justice and truth against injustice and falsehood. It also provides
                the members of the Shi'a faith with a catalog of heroic norms.</p>

        <div>
            <h2><a name="day">Day of Ashura:</a></h2>
            <p>The battle is commemorated during an annual ten-day period during the Islamic month of Muharram
                by many Muslims especially Shi'a, culminating on tenth day of the month, known as the Day of
                Ashura. On this day, Shi'a Muslims mourn, hold public processions, organize religious gathering,
                beat their chests and in some cases self-flagellate. Sunni Muslims likewise regard the incident as
                a historical tragedy; Husayn and his companions are widely regarded as martyrs by both Sunni and
                Shi'a Muslims.</p>
