    <h1>Image Types</h1>
    <p>Image formation is based on resolution and involves two technologies, i.e. Bitmap and 
    Vector.</p>
    <p>Bitmap are the small pixels (dots) with the help of which an image is created.</p>
    <p>For an image, standard resolution is 72ppi. In case of Newspapers and Magazines, standard
    resolution is 130dpi.</p>
    <p>It has three formats. Joint Photographer (JPG) format contains a variety of colours and 
    is mostly used for static pictures.</p>
    <p>Usually, PNG format does not have background and the utilization of FIG format is for 
    animated items.</p>
    <p>Vector images are made up of lines and colours.</p>
    <p>This type of images are considered better, as on enlargement, they sustain their quality.</p>
    <h1>Inserting Image</h1>
    <p>In HTML, we use 'img' tag to insert an image. It has three attributes namely src, alt and
    title.</p>
    <p>'src' attribute requires the full path of the image.</p>
    <p>'alt' attribute is used to provide description of image. It is displayed when image is not
    visible due to any reason. It should be relevant to the image.</p>
    <p>'title' attribute gives message when we place curser on the image.</p>
    <p>Note that three attribute relating to image has been abundant by HTML5, namely align (left,
    right), width and height.</p>
    <img src="C:\Gallery\my_pic1.jpg" alt="Author's Photograph" title="Its me!" width=105>
    <h1>Picture Tag</h1>
    <p>We can change our picture as per screen size with this tag.</p>
    <p>This tag has two inline tags, i.e. 'source' and 'src'.</p>
    <p>Inline tag 'source' has two attributes, namely 'media' and 'srcset'.</p>
    <p>Attribute 'media' is used to provide responsive size of an image or picture.</p>
    <p>Attribute 'srcset' requires the path of that image or picture.</p>
        <picture>
        <source media="(min-width:750px)" srcset="C:\Gallery\water_molecule_picture.jpg">
        <source media="(min-width:550px)" srcset="C:\Gallery\water_molecule_chemistry.jpg">
        <img src="C:\Gallery\water_molecule_graphical.jpg" alt="Water" style="width:auto;">
        </picture>
    <h1>Figure and Figcaption Tag</h1>
    <p>These tags are introduced by HTML5 for the first time.</p>
    <p>Figure tag is used to make a group of images.</p>
    <p>Figcaption tag is used within 'figure tag' and provides caption to the images.</p>
    <h2>The following example illustrate how to insert an image to a webpage:</h2>
    <p>Hi, Friends!<br>I am here to take you into the world of Chemistry.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="C:\Gallery\water_molecule_picture.jpg" width=300 height=250>
        <img src="C:\Gallery\water_molecule_graphical.jpg" width=300 height=250>
        <img src="C:\Gallery\water_molecule_chemistry.jpg" width=300 height=250>

    <p>Dear fellows,<br> As you know! "WATER" is life.<br>The chemical formula of water is
    H<sub>2</sub>O. A good water should be clean and tasteless.</p>
